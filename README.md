Digital Archives of Scores by Women Composers

Scores from the public domain by Women Composers released for free use.

Released by Michael Scott Cuthbert

Copyright (c) 2017, Michael Scott Cuthbert, some rights reserved.

Scores have been encoded in MusicXML to allow for computational analysis.
The study of music with computers is growing in popularity and power,
but the full power of digital musicology will only be unleashed if the
scores that are available to study are reflective of the full diversity
of compositional talent by humankind.  This repository attempts in some
small way to add to the number of scores available by releasing 
pieces by women composers who are out of copyright.

These works will also be available as part of the music21 toolkit.

or perform from these works as long as the copyright statement is
retained, and if you make arrangements of the works here, you must 
release your arrangements of your works under the same license.

Some non-US jurisdictions do not allow for copyrighting new engravings
of out of copyright works.  Others restrict the copyright to 25 years.
But isn't it better to contribute back to the community?
